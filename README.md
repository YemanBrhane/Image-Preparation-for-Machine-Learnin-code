# Image Preparation for Machine Learning
This software contains the most commonly
used image preprocessing (histogram matching, histogram qualization, normalization), Patch extraction ( 2D, 2,5D, 3D) and augmentation techniques to apply machine learning and deep learning in amedical image taking into consideration different ground truth types. It has also a visualzation tool to visualize 2D and 3D images.
